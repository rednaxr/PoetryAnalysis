The farm house lingers, though averse to square	1
With the new city street it has to wear A number in.	1
But what about the brook That held the house as in an elbow-crook?	1
I ask as one who knew the brook, its strength	1
And impulse, having dipped a finger length	1
And made it leap my knuckle, having tossed	1
A flower to try its currents where they crossed.	1
The meadow grass could be cemented down	1
From growing under pavements of a town;	1
The apple trees be sent to hearth-stone flame.	1
Is water wood to serve a brook the same?	1
How else dispose of an immortal force	1
No longer needed? Staunch it at its source	1
With cinder loads dumped down? The brook was	1
thrown Deep in a sewer dungeon under stone	1
In fetid darkness still to live and run -	1
And all for nothing it hd ever done	1
Except forget to go in fear perhaps.	1
No one would know except for ancient maps	1
That such a brook ran water. But I wonder	1
If from its being kept forever under	1
The thoughts may not have risen that so keep	1
This new-built city from both work and sleep.	1
